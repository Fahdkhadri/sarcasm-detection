# sarcasm-detection
A machine learning project to detect sarcasm in text using NLP techniques. It uses labeled data, text preprocessing (tokenization, TF-IDF), and models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and LSTM to classify text as sarcastic or not, improving the accuracy of sentiment analysis.
Sarcasm Detection using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting sarcastic statements in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Sarcasm is often challenging to identify due to its contextual and implicit nature, making this an interesting and valuable problem in sentiment analysis and opinion mining.

Objective
To build a model that can classify text as sarcastic or not sarcastic by analyzing linguistic patterns and contextual cues using supervised learning methods.

Features

Preprocessing of raw textual data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings

Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and LSTM

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of results and performance metrics

Tools & Technologies

Python

scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

NLTK / SpaCy

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset
The dataset used is derived from the News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection (or your actual dataset link). It consists of labeled news headlines indicating whether a headline is sarcastic or not.

Outcomes

Achieved high accuracy in detecting sarcasm in text

Demonstrated how contextual understanding in language can be modeled using ML

Created a reusable pipeline for sarcasm detection in real-world applications

Future Work

Integrate transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for improved contextual analysis

Deploy as a web app or API for real-time sarcasm detection

Expand dataset and support multi-language sarcasm detection
