  "is_sarcastic": 1,
  "article_link": "https://www.theonion.com/article-link"
}
Usage
The dataset is used for:

Training supervised machine learning models

Evaluating model performance on sarcasm detection

Preprocessing tasks like tokenization, stopword removal, etc.

Notes
Ensure data is cleaned and shuffled before training

For deep learning models (e.g., LSTM), consider limiting headline length or using padding

If using your own dataset, please ensure it follows the same format or update the preprocessing scripts accordingly
